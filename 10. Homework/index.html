      <p class="text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
        applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to
        access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
        components: <span class="text__italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React
        in the next section. But first,
        let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

        <p class="title-block__chapter">Chapter 3</p>
      </div>
      <p class="text">React Native runs on <span class="text__underline">React</span> , a popular open source library
        for building user
        interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
        can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
      </p>
      <p class="text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
      <ul class="text">
        <li><span class="text__bald">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
          in its examples: friendly, approachable
          creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
        <li><span class="text__bald">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
          write elements inside JavaScript like so:
          <code class="fundamentals__code text">&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat!&#60;/Text&#62;</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">The React docs have <span class="text__underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
        refer to learn even more.
        Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <code
          class="fundamentals__code text">name</code> for the cat, name, and
        embedding it with curly braces inside <code class="fundamentals__code text">&#60;Text&#62;</code>
      </p>
      <ul class="text">
        <li><span class="text__bald">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </li>
        <li><span class="text__bald">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
          configure how components render, state is like
          a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes
          from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="text-input">

        <h2 class="title-block__title">handling text input</h2>
        <p class="title-block__chapter">Chapter 4</p>
      </div>
      <p class="text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
        <span class="text__italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text
        changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
        that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
      </p>
      <p class="text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
        different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
        there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
